# Transaction-Clustering-PCA-GMM
This project focuses on unsupervised customer transaction segmentation using a combination of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM). The objective is to identify meaningful customer segments from high-dimensional transactional data, where traditional clustering methods may struggle due to feature redundancy and scale.
